# Image_Recognition_ML 
This project is built using deep learning,CNNs,tensorflow,google colab,kaggles datasets and Ml
Image Recognition is a hands-on, project-based journey into modern computer vision. Built and tested entirely in Google Colab , this project includes 5 days bootcamp that covers:

Day 1: Dataset download, MNIST & CIFAR-10 exploration, preprocessing, and visualization
Day 2: Building and training a CNN from scratch (TensorFlow/Keras)
Day 3: Data augmentation, batch normalization, and advanced model training
Day 4: Transfer learning with MobileNetV2 on Cats vs. Dogs dataset (Kaggle)
Day 5: Model evaluation, ROC/AUC, deployment tips
